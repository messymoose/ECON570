    "# 4. A Quick Note on Relative File Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to write file paths in order to tell python, but mainly pandas, where to read and write files from and to. The best practice when specifying file paths is to use *relative file paths*. Let's look at an example of how to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Suppose you have a folder on your computer's desktop called \"project\". That folder has data and code subfolders,\n",
    "\n",
    "📂 project  \n",
    "├── 📂 data  \n",
    "├── 📂 code  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"code\" you store things like Jupyter notebooks and code scripts. In the \"data\" folder are your datasets. Your first instict when loading a file into python would be to provide to python the whole path to your file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "MyData = pd.read_csv('/Users/Alejandro/Research/project/data/MyData.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can do **better** than that using _relative file paths_:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "MyData = pd.read_csv('../data/MyData.csv')\n",
